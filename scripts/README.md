# Scripts

This directory contains standalone utility scripts for various purposes, such as:
- Data ingestion and processing
- Model training pipelines
- Deployment scripts
- Ad-hoc tasks that don't belong in the core `src/` directory.

## Usage
Scripts can be executed directly from the command line after activating your virtual environment.
