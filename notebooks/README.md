# Notebooks

This directory is for Jupyter notebooks. Use these for:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Prototyping new features or models
- Experimentation and rapid iteration
- Presenting key findings or tutorials

## Best Practices
- Keep notebooks focused on a single task or topic.
- Avoid committing large output files; consider clearing outputs before committing.
- For production code, refactor logic from notebooks into `src/` modules.
